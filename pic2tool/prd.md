# Automated Development Recorder - Product Requirements Document

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2024-06-20
- **Status**: Final
- **Prepared for**: Development Handoff

## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the "Automated Development Recorder," a Windows 11 desktop application designed to automate software development tasks. The application will record on-screen user interactions, analyze the recording using computer vision AI to understand the workflow, and automatically generate executable code (ranging from simple automation scripts to full-stack application scaffolds) that replicates the recorded actions. The entire process is designed to be self-contained, running locally on the user's machine without external SaaS dependencies, ensuring privacy and control.

### Key Success Metrics
As this is a personal project, formal success metrics like user adoption or revenue are not applicable. The primary measure of success will be the application's ability to accurately convert recorded workflows into clean, functional code that meets the developer-user's needs.

## Product Vision

### Vision Statement
To create a powerful development assistant that radically accelerates workflow automation and prototyping by transforming observed user actions directly into executable code, minimizing repetitive manual coding.

### Problem Statement
Developers frequently perform repetitive tasks (e.g., UI testing, data entry, form filling) or build similar application structures. Manually scripting these workflows or bootstrapping new projects is time-consuming. This project aims to solve this by creating a tool that watches a developer perform a task once and automatically generates the code to perform it on demand.

### Solution Overview
The application will function as an intelligent screen recorder. It captures a video of a user workflow, deconstructs it into frames, and uses an AI vision model to interpret the on-screen elements and user inputs. It then synthesizes this information into a structured sequence of actions and translates that sequence into high-quality, documented code. An intelligence layer will determine the appropriate complexity of the output, from a simple script to a more complex application structure.

## Target Users

### Primary User Persona
- **Persona Name**: The Developer-User (Personal Use)
- **Goals**: To automate personal, repetitive software tasks and to rapidly prototype applications based on demonstrated UI flows.
- **Pain Points**: Spends significant time on manual UI testing, data entry, and setting up boilerplate code for new projects.
- **Use Cases**: Automating the filling of web forms, generating UI test scripts, creating data-entry bots, scaffolding new desktop or web applications based on a visual workflow.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### **Feature 1: Video Recording & Frame Processing**
- **Description**: The application must be able to record screen interactions and process the resulting video for analysis.
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to record my screen interactions to capture a workflow for automation.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The application provides an interface to start and stop screen recording.
  - The recorded video is saved locally in a common format (e.g., MP4, AVI).
  - The application can process a video file and extract its frames into a sequence of images.
  - The frame extraction process includes an efficiency option to skip consecutive frames that are highly similar, reducing redundant processing.
- **Priority**: High

#### **Feature 2: AI Vision Workflow Analysis**
- **Description**: The application uses AI vision to analyze video frames and build a structured understanding of the user's actions.
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want the application to analyze the video frames to identify UI elements, mouse/keyboard actions, and application context.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The AI module correctly identifies common UI elements like buttons, text fields, dropdown menus, and windows.
  - Mouse cursor position, clicks, and drag events are accurately detected and logged per frame.
  - Keyboard inputs are captured, including text entry and special keys.
  - The state of application windows (e.g., active window, window title) is tracked.
- **Priority**: High

#### **Feature 3: Action Sequence Code Generation**
- **Description**: The application transforms the structured sequence of actions into executable code.
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want the application to convert the analyzed actions into documented, executable code.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - A sequence of simple actions (e.g., click button, type text) is correctly converted into a Python automation script using libraries like `pyautogui` or `selenium`.
  - A sequence of complex UI interactions is correctly converted into the foundational code for a full-stack application.
  - The generated code is well-documented, clean, and includes setup instructions (e.g., `requirements.txt`).
- **Priority**: High

#### **Feature 4: Intelligence Layer for Output Selection**
- **Description**: The application intelligently determines the most appropriate type of code to generate based on the complexity of the recorded workflow.
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want the application to automatically decide whether a simple script or a full application is the right output for my recorded workflow.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The system can differentiate between a linear, simple task (suitable for a script) and a multi-step, complex interaction (requiring an application structure).
  - The correct code generator (script vs. application) is invoked automatically based on the analysis.
- **Priority**: High

#### **Feature 5: Secure and Resilient API Key Management**
- **Description**: The application must handle user-provided AI vision API keys securely and efficiently.
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want a secure way to use my vision AI API keys and have the application automatically rotate them during large batch jobs to avoid rate-limiting issues.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The application provides a secure interface for the user to enter and store their API keys (e.g., for Google Vision, OpenAI).
  - For processing large numbers of frames, the application implements a key rotation mechanism to cycle through multiple user-provided keys.
  - API keys are not hard-coded and are handled in a way that prioritizes local privacy.
- **Priority**: High

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: The application, particularly the AI processing module, must run efficiently on a standard developer machine (e.g., i7 processor, 16GB RAM) without causing significant system slowdown.
- **Throughput**: The application must be able to process videos in manageable chunks to avoid excessive memory consumption.

### Security Requirements
- **Privacy**: All processing must be done locally on the user's machine. If cloud-based AI services are used, it must be through user-provided API keys only. The application itself will not transmit user data to any third-party service.

### Usability Requirements
- **Usability**: As a personal tool, advanced accessibility features are not a primary requirement. The user interface should be functional and clear for a technical developer-user.

### Reliability Requirements
- **Stability**: The application must have a low crash rate.
- **Accuracy**: The video processing and action analysis must be highly accurate to produce useful code. The system must include error handling for ambiguous or unclear actions in recordings.

### Cost
- The application must be completely free to use, with no reliance on SaaS subscriptions or paid third-party services, other than the user's own consumption of AI services via their API keys.

## Technical Constraints

- **Platform**: The application must be a native desktop application for Windows 11.
- **Video Support**: The application should support multiple common video input formats.
- **Architecture**: The application must have a modular design to allow for future enhancements and to facilitate processing videos in chunks.

## Timeline and Milestones
- As a personal project, there is no formal timeline or set of milestones.

## Assumptions and Constraints
- The user will provide their own valid API keys for the vision AI services they wish to use.
- The user has a compatible Windows 11 machine that meets the performance requirements.
- The project is intended for personal use, and requirements for multi-user support, team collaboration, and advanced administration are out of scope.
