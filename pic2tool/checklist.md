- **Prepared for**: Development Handoff

## Overview
This checklist provides a comprehensive guide for developing the Automated Development Recorder application from initial setup through deployment. Each section contains specific, actionable tasks that should be completed in a logical order.

## Pre-Development Setup

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Install Node.js (v20.x or later)
- [ ] Install TypeScript globally (`npm install -g typescript`)
- [ ] Install Git
- [ ] Install FFmpeg and ensure it's available in the system's PATH
- [ ] Set up a code editor (e.g., VS Code) with recommended extensions for ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript

### Project Initialization
- [ ] Initialize a new Node.js project (`npm init -y`)
- [ ] Install core dependencies: `electron`, `react`, `react-dom`
- [ ] Install development dependencies: `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `typescript`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `electron-builder`, `webpack`, and related loaders
- [ ] Install application logic dependencies: `fluent-ffmpeg`, `electron-store`, `electron-safe-storage`, `electron-log`
- [ ] Configure `tsconfig.json` for the project with strict mode enabled
- [ ] Set up the Electron main process entry point (`src/main.ts`) and preload script (`src/preload.ts`)
- [ ] Set up the React renderer process entry point (`src/renderer.tsx` and `index.html`)
- [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier with project-specific rules
- [ ] Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules`, build artifacts, and local environment files

### Documentation Setup
- [ ] Create a `README.md` with project overview and detailed setup instructions for other developers (or future self)
- [ ] Create a `docs` folder for development notes and decision logs

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and UI Shell

### Backend Foundation (Electron Main Process)
- [ ] Implement the main application window creation and management in `main.ts`
- [ ] Set up IPC (Inter-Process Communication) listeners (`ipcMain`) to handle commands from the UI
- [ ] Create stubs for all core modules: `RecordingModule`, `VideoProcessingModule`, `VisionAnalysisModule`, `ActionSequenceModule`, `CodeGenerationModule`
- [ ] Implement secure storage for API keys using `electron-safe-storage`
- [ ] Configure `electron-log` for file-based logging

### Frontend Foundation (React Renderer Process)
- [ ] Structure the React app with main components: `App.tsx`, `Header`, `MainContent`, `StatusBar`
- [ ] Create UI components for the primary interface:
    - [ ] Record/Stop Button
    - [ ] Video File Selector
    - [ ] Configuration panel for API key entry
    - [ ] Progress bar and status message display area
    - [ ] Code display area for final output
- [ ] Set up IPC senders (`ipcRenderer`) to communicate commands (e.g., 'start-recording') to the main process
- [ ] Implement basic state management for the UI (e.g., using React Hooks like `useState`, `useReducer`)

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Configure Jest for unit testing TypeScript files
- [ ] Configure React Testing Library for testing UI components
- [ ] Create a basic test script in `package.json` (e.g., `"test": "jest"`)
- [ ] (Optional) Set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow to run `npm install` and `npm test` on push events

## Phase 2: Feature Implementation

### Feature: Video Recording & Processing
- [ ] Implement screen capture logic in `RecordingModule` using Electron's `desktopCapturer` API
- [ ] Connect the UI Record/Stop button to the `RecordingModule` via IPC
- [ ] Integrate `fluent-ffmpeg` in `VideoProcessingModule` to extract frames from the saved video file
- [ ] Implement the algorithm to compare consecutive frames and skip those that are nearly identical
- [ ] Add progress reporting via IPC from the processing module back to the UI progress bar

### Feature: AI Vision Workflow Analysis
- [ ] Define a generic `VisionService` TypeScript interface
- [ ] Implement `OpenAIVisionService` and `GoogleVisionService` classes that conform to the interface
- [ ] Implement the API key rotation logic within the `VisionAnalysisModule` to cycle through user-provided keys
- [ ] Add UI in the settings panel for users to add, remove, and select their preferred AI service and API keys
- [ ] Implement the core logic to send frame data to the selected vision service and await the structured JSON response
- [ ] Store the JSON analysis results locally in the project folder

### Feature: Action Sequence & Code Generation
- [ ] Develop the rules engine in `ActionSequenceModule` to parse the array of JSON analysis results into a logical list of user actions (e.g., `CLICK`, `TYPE`, `SCROLL`)
- [ ] Implement the `ScriptGenerator` in `CodeGenerationModule` to convert the action list into a Python script using `pyautogui` syntax
- [ ] Implement the `ApplicationGenerator` to create a basic project folder structure for more complex workflows
- [ ] Implement the `IntelligenceLayer` logic that analyzes the complexity of the action sequence to decide which generator to use
- [ ] Connect the final output to the UI code display area

## Phase 3: Integration and Testing

### Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all core logic: API key rotation, frame comparison, action sequence generation, and code generation templates
- [ ] Write component tests for all major React components, simulating user interactions
- [ ] Create an end-to-end test with a short, simple recording to verify the entire pipeline from video input to code output, using a mock vision API
- [ ] Manually test with real video recordings of varying lengths and complexities

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Conduct a full code review to ensure adherence to standards
- [ ] Perform a security review, focusing on the handling and storage of API keys
- [ ] Test application performance with a large video file to check memory usage and processing time
- [ ] Test error handling for scenarios like invalid API keys, unsupported video formats, or ambiguous actions

## Phase 4: Deployment Preparation

### Production Build
- [ ] Add the build configuration for Windows (`win`) to the `electron-builder` section of `package.json`
- [ ] Create application icons for the executable and installer
- [ ] Create and test a production build script in `package.json` (e.g., `"dist": "electron-builder"`)
- [ ] Ensure all development-only tools and logs are excluded from the final package

### Launch Preparation
- [ ] Finalize the `README.md` with clear instructions on how to install and use the application
- [ ] Add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT License for personal projects)
- [ ] Run the distribution script to create the final `.exe` installer and portable executable
